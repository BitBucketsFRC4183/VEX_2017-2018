// DriverInterface contains the functions and tasks for controlling the drive base
//
// Since RobotC likes to define the motor assignments as part of the configuration
// pragmas in the competition template, we need to find a way of passing that information
// to this interface. This includes some form of list/array of motor identifiers to
// include how many and which are left and right side.
//
// The next important thing is to provide a task for basic driver control.
// This task is simple and should initially just read the drive/turn commands,
// scale the commands, pass the commands into an arcade drive function to split
// the left/right value, and then pass control to the motors.
//
// In this early stage we don't need to worry about any special behaviors, like
// interactions with autonomous, speed control, or even special driver modes (like
// an automatic 180)... just wrap all of the basic driver controls into one place.

// master motor IDs for the left and right motors.
// Normally we would want a private or protected interface
// but RobotC does not provide such. All we can do here is
// create two globals to be initialized by the main program
// when it starts. To make it look more like a class we will
// just place the items in a struct

// for driving the drive motors. Initialization and motor
// setup should bet at the top of the task, OUTSIDE the

//
// To avoid having to edit this code, we should pass a right
// and left motor "id" to some variables. If this were a class-like
// interface we would be initializing some member variables.

// we would prefer to slave the motors to avoid needing to send multiple
